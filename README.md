# Reader Comrade
Reader Comrade is a personal learning project. My objective is to strengthen my knowledge of SOTA frameworks for designing multi-agent systems powered by large language models. **This tool should not summarize or help the user not to read the book. Its role should rather be that of a reading companion.**

## Read Comrade - A Reflective Assistant for Deep Engagement with Books
Here will be a nice description of the final result in a few days.

### Monitoring of the functional objectives of this project:
- [ ] RAG capabilities on a local database.
- [ ] Agency on a web query tool in case any user prompt requires it.
- [ ] Flow control between agents to router tasks in a deterministic manner.
- [ ] Prevention of hallucinations using LLM parameters and [Self-RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511) techniques.
- [ ] Ability to ask questions to the user based on a context window (user's progress in the book)
